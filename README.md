# Sprint Challenge Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past sprint and apply them in a concrete project. This sprint explored **how to build web services based on the REST (REpresentational State Transfer) architectural style**. During this sprint, you studied **Node.js and Express, server side routing, how to write Express middleware and how to deploy an API to Heroku**. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate your mastery of these skills by **designing and creating a web API to manage the following resources: `Projects` and `Actions`**.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the sprint challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your TL if you need direction.

_You have **three hours** to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly._

## Introduction

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, your project should provide an API that has Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) functionality for both `projects` and `actions`.

### Database Schemas

The description of the structure and extra information about each _resource_ stored in the included database (`./data/lambda.db3`) is listed below.

#### Projects

| Field       | Data Type | Metadata                                                                    |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id          | number    | no need to provide it when creating projects, the database will generate it |
| name        | string    | required.                                                                   |
| description | string    | required.                                                                   |
| completed   | boolean   | used to indicate if the project has been completed, not required            |

#### Actions

| Field       | Data Type | Metadata                                                                                         |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| id          | number    | no need to provide it when creating posts, the database will automatically generate it.          |
| project_id  | number    | required, must be the id of an existing project.                                                 |
| description | string    | up to 128 characters long, required.                                                             |
| notes       | string    | no size limit, required. Used to record additional notes or requirements to complete the action. |
| completed   | boolean   | used to indicate if the action has been completed, not required                                  |

### Database Persistence Helpers

The `/data/helpers` folder includes files you can use to manage the persistence of _project_ and _action_ data. These files are `projectModel.js` and `actionModel.js`. Both files publish the following api, which you can use to store, modify and retrieve each resource:

**All these helper methods return a promise. Remember to use .then().catch() or async/await.**

- `get()`: resolves to an array of all the resources contained in the database. If you pass an `id` to this method it will return the resource with that id if one is found.
- `insert()`: calling insert passing it a resource object will add it to the database and return the newly created resource.
- `update()`: accepts two arguments, the first is the `id` of the resource to update, and the second is an object with the `changes` to apply. It returns the updated resource. If a resource with the provided `id` is not found, the method returns `null`.
- `remove()`: the remove method accepts an `id` as it's first parameter and, upon successfully deleting the resource from the database, returns the number of records deleted.

The `projectModel.js` helper includes an extra method called `getProjectActions()` that takes a _project id_ as it's only argument and returns a list of all the _actions_ for the _project_.

We have provided test data for all the resources.

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons) and your team lead as the evaluate your solution.

## Interview Questions

Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. You might prepare by writing down your own answers before hand.

1. The core features of Node.js and Express and why they are useful.

The core features for node are :
JavaScript on the server: 
node use the same programming langage as a JS, and its helpful because it makes it easier to share code between client and server
Single-threaded: it removes the complexity that is included in working with multiple threads
Asynchronous: it can work in full advantage with the processor where its used, and this is important because node will work in a single CPU
Npm repository: we can access to a large and useful libraries that some of them are free in the form of npm modules

The code features for Express are :
Express is one of the many modules of node and their core features are:
Middleware: 
we can use this feature when we need to request and/or response some objects, work on them, or trigger some actions like logging and security. 
Routing: 
with this feature, express can select which request handler funciton can be executed. it will do it with the URL visited, and the HTTP method used.
Routers for Application Modularity: 
when we break app into routers, one router can serve our SPA, and another our API. Each router will have its own middleware, and routing, and this combination will imporve functionality.
Convenience Helpers: 
express provide helpers to make writing web applications and API servers easier like response.status(), respnse.send(), and reques.ip
Views: 
they help to provide a better way to dynamically render HTML on the server, and generate it using other languages

1. Understand and explain the use of Middleware?
middleware are functions that are executed during the lifecycle of a request to the express server. Each middleware has access to the HTTP request and response for each route that is attached to.  These functions are used to modify  req and res objects for task like fetching req bodies , and/or adding respons headers.

1. The basic principles of the REST architectural style.
The principles of the Rest architectural style are:
- everything is a resource.
- each resource is accessible via a unique URL
- resources can have multiple representations
- communication happens over a stateless protocol (HTTP)
- resource management happens via HTTP methods 

1. Understand and explain the use of Express Routers.
- Routing in express is when an application endpoint respond to client request.  we can do this by combining an HTTP request method or verb (get, post, put, delete), and a path pattern where whe define URLs in our app.

1. Describe tooling used to manually test the correctness of an API.
We can used for testing  the correctness of an API postman or inmsonia.  They will test, and each HTTP request method is valid, and the performance is good.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set Up

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project
- [ ] Add your team lead as collaborator on Github
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!)
- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly
- [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`

### Task 2: Project Requirements

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

#### NPM Scripts

- [ ] An _npm script_ named _"server"_ that uses `nodemon`to run the API server.
- [ ] Use _nodemon_ as a development time dependency only that is not deployed to production.
- [ ] An _npm script_ named _"start"_ that uses `node` to run the API server.

#### Build an API

- [ ] Design and build endpoints for performing CRUD operations on _projects_ and _actions_. When adding an action, make sure the `project_id` provided belongs to an existing `project`. If you try to add an action with an `id` of 3 and there is no project with that `id` the database will return an error.
- [ ] Add an endpoint for retrieving the list of actions for a project.
- [ ] Use an HTTP client like `postman` or `insomnia` to test the API's endpoints.
- [ ] Use Express Routers to organize the API's code.

In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. You will be scored on your adherence to proper code style and good organization. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.

### Task 3: Stretch Goals

After finishing your required elements, you can push your work further. These goals may or may not be things you have learned in this module but they build on the material you just studied. Time allowing, stretch your limits and see if you can deliver on the following optional goals:

- [ ] Deploy the API to Heroku.
- [ ] Configure the API to support environment variables.
- [ ] Use middleware for validation of incoming data.

## Submission format

Follow these steps for completing your project.

- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
- [ ] Add your team lead as a reviewer on the pull-request
- [ ] Your team lead will count the project as complete after receiving your pull-request
